* Overview

A simple tool to download and maintain up-to-date Top-Level Domain (TLD) lists from the official IANA registry.

This repository contains scripts and data files for fetching and processing the official list of Top-Level Domains (TLDs) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The tool automatically downloads the latest TLD list and provides both original case and lowercase versions.

* Files

- =refresh= :: Main bash script that downloads and processes TLD data
- =tlds.txt= :: Lowercase version of the TLD list (processed)
- =tlds_original.txt= :: Original case TLD list (as downloaded from IANA)
- =tlds_original.txt.bak= :: Backup of the previous original TLD list

* Usage

** Refreshing TLD Data

To update the TLD lists with the latest data from IANA:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./refresh
#+END_SRC

The script will:
1. Download the latest TLD list from https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
2. Create a backup of the existing original file
3. Save the new data as =tlds_original.txt=
4. Generate a lowercase version as =tlds.txt=

** Data Format

Both TLD files contain:
- A header comment with version and last updated timestamp
- One TLD per line
- All officially registered top-level domains

Example content:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Version 2025091800, Last Updated Thu Sep 18 07:07:01 2025 UTC
AAA
AARP
ABB
ABBOTT
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

The lowercase version (=tlds.txt=) contains the same data but with all domains converted to lowercase for easier programmatic processing.

* Features

- *Automatic updates* from the official IANA source
- *Error handling* with proper exit codes and cleanup
- *Backup mechanism* to preserve previous versions
- *Dual format output* (original case + lowercase)
- *Safe operations* with temporary files and proper cleanup

* Requirements

- Bash shell
- =curl= for downloading data
- =tr= for case conversion
- Standard Unix utilities (=mv=, =rm=, =mktemp=)

* Data Source

The TLD data is sourced directly from IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority):

| Property         | Value                                                    |
|------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| Source URL       | https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt      |
| Authority        | Official registry for internet domain names             |
| Update frequency | IANA updates this list as new TLDs are approved         |

* Use Cases

Might be useful for:
- Domain validation in web applications
- Email address validation
- DNS monitoring and analysis
- Research and data analysis projects
- Maintaining local TLD databases
